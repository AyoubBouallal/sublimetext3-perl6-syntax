# Sublime Text 3 Perl6 Syntax Highlighter
This is an attempt to get a Sublime Text 3 syntax file going.

I was sick and tired of there being so few GUI-based text editors with Perl6 syntax highlighting, so I'm starting an effort to make one more option. Plain and simple. 

## To use this syntax
Take the .sublime-syntax file and place it under your "Packages" folder. The location of this folder is dependent on your OS. On Windows 10, the parent Sublime Text 3 folder is found somewhere in your user "Roaming"  path.
